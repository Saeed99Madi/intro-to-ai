## Content Creation Tips

### For Each Lab Notebook:

1. **Start with Why**
   - Explain the problem and why it matters
   - Show real-world applications
   - Motivate the learning

2. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Implement from scratch first (education)
   - Show library version second (practical)
   - Compare and contrast

3. **Visualize Everything**
   - Use matplotlib/plotly for visual explanations
   - Show algorithm progress step-by-step
   - Make abstract concepts concrete

4. **Progressive Complexity**
   - Start simple (toy examples)
   - Add complexity gradually
   - End with real-world applications

5. **Interactive Learning**
   - Include exercises throughout
   - Provide immediate feedback
   - Encourage experimentation

### For Each Gradio App:

1. **Make it Educational**
   - Show algorithm working step-by-step
   - Display metrics and statistics
   - Explain what's happening

2. **User-Friendly**
   - Clear instructions
   - Sensible defaults
   - Example inputs
   - Good error messages

3. **Performant**
   - Reasonable default parameters
   - Progress indicators for slow operations
   - Caching where appropriate

## Testing Your Content

Before considering any week complete:

```bash
# 1. Fresh environment test
rm -rf .venv

pip install -e .

# 2. Test all notebooks
jupyter lab
# Run "Restart Kernel & Run All" on each notebook

# 3. Test Gradio apps
python 1_search/pathfinding_app.py
# Test all features and edge cases

# 4. Check for errors
python -m pytest  # if you add tests

# 5. Documentation check
# Read through all markdown files
# Click all links to verify they work
```

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Start working
cd intro-to-ai
source .venv/bin/activate

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter lab

# Run a Gradio app
python week_folder/app_name.py

# Check what's installed
pip list
