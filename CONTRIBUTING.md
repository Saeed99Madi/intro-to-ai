## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Include docstrings for functions and classes

**Example:**
```python
def breadth_first_search(graph, start, goal):
    """
    Perform BFS to find a path from start to goal.

    Args:
        graph: Dictionary representing the graph
        start: Starting node
        goal: Target node

    Returns:
        List of nodes from start to goal, or None if no path exists
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Notebook Guidelines

- Clear markdown explanations before code cells
- Run all cells before submitting
- Clear outputs if they contain large data
- Include visualizations where helpful
- Add learning objectives at the top

### Commit Messages

Write clear commit messages:
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Be specific ("Fix BFS algorithm bug" not "Fix bug")
- Reference issues if applicable ("Fixes #123")

**Good examples:**
- "Add visualization for A* search algorithm"
- "Fix typo in Week 1 Lab 2"
- "Improve explanation of heuristic functions"

### Testing

- Test your code before submitting
- Ensure it works with the course dependencies
- Include example usage
