# Week 2: Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

How do we represent what we know? How do we reason with that knowledge? This week explores how AI systems use logic to represent facts, draw conclusions, and solve problems that require reasoning.

```

## Key Concepts

### Propositional Logic
- **Propositions**: Statements that are true or false
- **Connectives**: AND (âˆ§), OR (âˆ¨), NOT (Â¬), IMPLIES (â†’), IFF (â†”)
- **Inference**: Deriving new facts from known facts
- **Satisfiability**: Finding truth assignments that make formulas true

### First-Order Logic
- **Predicates**: Properties and relations
- **Quantifiers**: âˆ€ (for all), âˆƒ (there exists)
- **Terms**: Objects, variables, functions
- **Unification**: Matching patterns to facts

### Knowledge Representation
- **Facts**: Things that are true
- **Rules**: If-then relationships
- **Queries**: Questions to answer
- **Inference**: Deriving answers from facts and rules

## Real-World Applications

- **Expert Systems**: Medical diagnosis, troubleshooting, recommendations
- **Semantic Web**: Knowledge graphs (Google, Amazon)
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Parsing meaning from text
- **Robotics**: Planning and reasoning about actions
- **Legal Reasoning**: Analyzing contracts and regulations
- **Database Query Optimization**: Query planning

## Prerequisites

- Week 1: Search (helpful but not required)
- Basic Python (functions, classes, loops)
- High school logic (understanding of "if-then" statements)

## Tools and Libraries

- **SymPy**: Symbolic mathematics and logic
- **itertools**: Combinations and permutations
- **NetworkX**: Visualizing knowledge graphs
- **Gradio**: Interactive applications

## Classic Problems

### Knights and Knaves
On an island, knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie. Can you determine who is who?

### The Zebra Puzzle
Five people live in five houses. Given clues about their nationalities, drinks, pets, etc., who owns the zebra?

### Wumpus World
Navigate a cave with pits and a monster using logical reasoning about what you sense.

## Example: Simple Knowledge Base

```python
# Facts
knowledge_base = [
    "Socrates is a man",
    "All men are mortal"
]

# Query
query = "Is Socrates mortal?"

# Inference
# From "Socrates is a man" and "All men are mortal"
# We can infer: "Socrates is mortal"
answer = True
```

## Common Logic Puzzles

### Puzzle 1: The Liar Paradox
A says: "B is a knight"
B says: "A and I are of opposite types"

Who is the knight and who is the knave?

### Puzzle 2: Three Gods
Three gods (Truth, False, Random) answer yes/no questions. You can ask 3 questions to identify them.

### Puzzle 3: The Muddy Children
N children are told "at least one of you has mud on your forehead." When will they figure out their own status?

## Tips for Success

### Understanding Logic
- Draw truth tables to understand connectives
- Practice translating English to logical statements
- Verify your reasoning with examples

### Debugging Logic
- Check your premises (are facts correct?)
- Trace inference steps manually
- Test with simple cases first

### Building Systems
- Start with a small knowledge base
- Add rules incrementally
- Test each rule individually

## Exercises & Challenges

### Basic Exercises
1. Create truth tables for all logical connectives
2. Translate natural language statements to logic
3. Solve 5 Knights and Knaves puzzles
4. Implement Modus Ponens inference rule

### Intermediate Challenges
1. Build a family tree reasoner with first-order logic
2. Solve the Zebra puzzle programmatically
3. Create an expert system for a domain of your choice
4. Implement the DPLL SAT solver algorithm

2. Create a natural language to logic translator
3. Implement a Prolog-like interpreter
4. Build a knowledge graph for a real domain

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Logical statements seem ambiguous
**Solution**: Be explicit! "All birds fly" should be "For all X, if X is a bird, then X flies"

### Issue: Inference taking too long
**Solution**: Use Horn clauses and forward chaining for efficiency

### Issue: Can't represent certain statements
**Solution**: You might need first-order logic instead of propositional logic

### Issue: Getting circular reasoning
**Solution**: Check for cycles in your rules, use depth limits
